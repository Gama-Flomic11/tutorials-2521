# How to use these notes.

Essentially each of the programs is linked in this program below

All you need to do is copy and paste into a new file look for the comments that say they need to be completed, if it has already been completed have a check of this and then compile and run the appropriate code.

# Code this week


[pointerRev01](pointerRev01.c/) - The first exercise with revising pointers.

[pointerRev02](pointerRev02.c/) - Working with the swap function.

[linkedList01](linkedList01.c/) - Summing a list of pointers.

[linkedList02](linkedList02.c/) - Deleting a value in a list with a node representation.

[linkedList03](linkedList03.c/) - Deleting a value in a list with a head + node representation.

# Notes on this week

This week we didn't quite get up to listDelete which linkedList02 and linkedList03. My best suggestion is to think about the three cases which are
<summary> Hint </summary>
<details> 
<li> Empty list
<li> Deleting the first value 
<li> Deleting a middle value
</details>
<br/>
A good challenge is to code this up not using a pointer to point to the element before.
<br/>
<br/>
A note also is make sure you are coding with the correct list interpretation.

If you are struggling with this let me know and I can give you some help.
